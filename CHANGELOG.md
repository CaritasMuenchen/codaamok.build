## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Removed requirement to use emoji :shipit: in commit message for pipeline to start - was pointless if I wanted to allow ad-hoc use of the pipeline via workflow dispatch

### Fixed
- Export-UnreleasedNotes constantly wrote 'None' to the release notes and did not use the change log data

## [1.0.0] - 2021-09-18
### Added
- Initial release
